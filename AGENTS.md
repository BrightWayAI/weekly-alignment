# Team Alignment — OpenAI host entrypoint

This repository supports Claude Code/Cowork, ChatGPT desktop Local Work, and Codex
from one canonical workflow source.

Read in this order:

1. `references/openai-portability.md` for host capability and degradation rules.
2. The matching `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for workflow instructions.
3. Any `commands/<name>.md` and references named by that skill.

Treat `commands/` and authored `skills/` as canonical. OpenAI alias skills are thin
entrypoints and must not fork workflow behavior. Treat the installed plugin directory
as read-only at runtime. User state belongs under the shared `<config-root>` resolved
by the precedence chain in the portability reference.
Read-only Codex role bindings live in `.codex/agents/`. If role delegation is unavailable, execute the same source role inline and preserve its read-only boundary.

Never fabricate connector data. Keep drafts as drafts, and confirm any external write,
send, schedule registration, or destructive action at the point of action.
